Fire: Friend and Foe

Early man didn't know what fire was, but he must have seen the damage it could cause. He must have watched lightning and volcanoes long before he began to use fire himself. The fire was powerful and dangerous, and he was frightened.
Fire may have puzzled early man but we now know that fire is the result of a chemical reaction. When the oxygen in the air combines with carbon and hydrogen in fuel, a chemical reaction takes place. Energy in the form of heat and light is released in this process. This is what we call fire.
Three things are needed to make fire- fuel, oxygen and heat. Wood, coal, cooking gas and petrol are some samples of fuel. Oxygen comes from the air. That is why, when you blow on smouldering paper, it often bursts into flame. The third thing needed to make a fire is heat. Fuel and oxygen do not make fire by themselves, or else a newspaper or a stick lying in the open would catch fire on its own.
